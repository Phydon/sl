# sl

**simple ls**

> simply list everything in a directory

> just keep it simple

> for more 'fancy' stuff, use ```ls```

* files and directories in a seperate colour, everything else is grey
* by default it only lists names 
* accepts a path as an argument (just as ls)


## TODO

* add flags: show [type, size, last modified], choose colours
